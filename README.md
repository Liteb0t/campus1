Most important is TRACKING HOURS  
  Studetns with visa can only work up to 20h/week
  But they can only work 15h/week
  Hours entered into a tracker
  Email sent when the student is aproved, says number of hours
  Want to make it easy for the student, manager, and uni while keeping GDPR rules
  Should be able to see only the students details you need, cant just see everyones
  Employers see only the hours
  Could have: Try to ensure students work the maximum number of hours they can, eg. if an employer cant fulfill houes let them work for someone else
  System is used to audit the houred. Timesheets are currently done manually
  THey use outlook
  Staff use mobile phones so website may be suitable
  Payroll is monthly
  Currently timesheets are in excel and admins manually put hours in, its changing to students entering the hours, preferebly weekly
  Some students have visas but not restricted hours eg. refugee status
  Students will get a return saying how many hours are approved
  Emails are currently manual but can be automated
  Recruiter: want to hire 5tudents, comes to us witha  form to advertise on handskake, "I want dave to work 10 hours"
  if students favourite the job campus gets the successfulk students and asks them for right-to-work documents, then inform which students are eligible to work and tell recruiters how many hjours each students can work
  written terms and conditions letter, one for studetns with vidsas and without
  We have to email the student and the recruiter with specific hoiurs, audit pay against tracker
  Student can say which dayus they cant work
